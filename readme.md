You are given a Tree having N nodes . Each node have given value initially. To travel from one node to another node, there is exactly one way . The distance between adjacent node is One. Motku is the sum of value of nodes on the path from U to V .

You have to answer Q Queries .Queries is described as follows. . You will be given a node U and value K. Can you find the node which is at a distance K (exactly ) from node U? If there are many nodes at distance K from node U then find the minimum Motku among of them.
